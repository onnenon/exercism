# Exercism Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various programming exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/). The solutions are organized by language and exercise, making it easy to browse and reference code for different tracks.

## Structure

- `solutions/` — Main directory containing all solutions
  - `clojure/`, `elixir/`, `gleam/`, `haskell/`, `javascript/`, `ocaml/`, `python/`, `scala/` — Subdirectories for each language track
    - Each language directory contains folders for individual exercises, sometimes with numbered subfolders for multiple attempts or steps

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal archive and reference for my progress on Exercism. It may be useful for:
- Reviewing solutions to past exercises
- Comparing approaches across different languages
- Tracking learning progress

## Notes
- All code is written by me as part of learning and practicing on Exercism.
- Exercise descriptions and problem statements are available on the Exercism website.

Feel free to explore the solutions or use them as inspiration for your own learning journey!
