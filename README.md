This repository contains my solutions to various programming exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/). The solutions are organized by language and exercise, making it easy to browse and reference code for different tracks.

## 🗂️ Structure

- `solutions/` — Main directory containing all solutions
  - 🟢 `clojure/` — Functional programming solutions
  - 💜 `elixir/` — Actor model exercises
  - ✨ `gleam/` — Type-safe functional programming
  - 🎩 `haskell/` — Pure functional solutions
  - 🟡 `javascript/` — JavaScript exercises
  - 🐫 `ocaml/` — ML family programming
  - 🐍 `python/` — Python solutions
  - 🔴 `scala/` — Scala exercises

Each language directory contains folders for individual exercises, sometimes with numbered subfolders for multiple attempts or iterations.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a personal archive and reference for my progress on Exercism. It may be useful for:

- 📚 Reviewing solutions to past exercises
- 🔄 Comparing approaches across different languages
- 📈 Tracking learning progress

## 📝 Notes

- All code is written by me as part of learning and practicing on Exercism
- Exercise descriptions and problem statements are available on the Exercism website

Feel free to explore the solutions or use them as inspiration for your own learning journey! 🚀
